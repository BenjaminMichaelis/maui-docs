# Using the ZIP Archive

This article explains what the `ZIP` archive for Telerik UI for .NET MAUI components includes, and how to get it.

The most common way to install the Telerik UI for .NET MAUI components is to use the [Telerik NuGet feed](). However, you can also use an [automated installer]({%slug automated-installer%}), or a ZIP archive.

You can download the ZIP from the [Downloads](https://www.telerik.com/account/downloads/product-download?product=MAUI) section of your Telerik account. Go to [Available Product Files]({%slug download-product-files%}) topic for detailed steps on how to navigate to the product download page.

The `ZIP` archive provides the following:

* `Binaries`&mdash;Contains the `Net8` and `Net9` folders. Each folder contains the needed assemblies for Android, iOS, MacCatalyst, and WinUI. You can use them to manually reference the Telerik UI for .NET MAUI dlls into your app.

* `Examples`&mdash;Contains the sample applications demonstrating the Telerik UI for .NET MAUI controls. For more details, go to the [Sample Applications]({%slug sampleapps-overview%}) section.

* `LicenseAgreements`&mdash;Provides the product End-User License Agreement (EULA).

* `Packages`&mdash;Contains the `Telerik.UI.for.Maui.[version].nupkg` Nuget package. Use it in case you need to set up a local Nuget server and reference the `Telerik.UI.for.Maui.[version].nupkg` from there.

* `VSExtensions`&mdash;Contains the Visual Studio Extension for Visual Studio 2022. For more details, go to [Visual Studio Integration] section.
