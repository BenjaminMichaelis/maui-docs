# Overview

Telerik UI for .NET MAUI provides a few fully-features demo applications demonstrating our .NET MAUI controls. You can review the source code of each app and get familiar with the way various Telerik .NET MAUI controls are utilized.

## Controls Samples App

The **Telerik UI for .NET MAUI Controls Samples** is the application you can find in the app stores (Google Play, Apple App Store and  Windows Store). It is highly polished and has many scenario-specific use cases designed to show off a subset of features for each component.

## SDKBrowser App

The SDKBrowser is a set of examples that explain how to use the features of a control. Contrary to the Controls Samples application, the SDKBrowser shows the components in their pure form without adding extra styling and polishing. It's the go-to source for "how do I use X in Y control". Most of the code snippets available in the documentation are directly generated from the examples in the SDKBrowser (you can see special comments in the code for this).

## Crypto Tracker App 

Crypto Tracker demo is a real-case crypto application that shows changes in cryptocurrency prices, built with the Telerik UI for .NET MAUI controls.
