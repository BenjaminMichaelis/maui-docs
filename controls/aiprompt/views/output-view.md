# Output View

The Output View shows the responses generated by the underlying AI service. Each response renders in its dedicated output item and provides two options to the userâ€”to copy the content of the response or to retry the request. The Output View is activated as soon as output items are added to the `AIPrompt`'`OutputItems` collection. 

Once the user fills out a prompt within the Input View and requests a response, the AIPrompt control will raise `PromptRequest` event/`PromptRequestCommand` command. In it, you can contact your AI model with the request. When the responses are generated by the AI service, you can create an `AIPromptOutputItem` object for each response and add it to the `OutputItems` collection. Once items are added to the `OutputItems` collection, the Output View will become active.

Each output item will also feature two additional options-to upvote or downvote the response. To handle this interaction, you can use the `OutputItemRatingChangedCommand` command.

The `AiPromptOutputItem` provides the following properties:

* `Title`(`string`)&mdash;Defines the response title.
* `InputText`(`string`)&mdash;Defines the input text (the end-user's request) that was sent to the AI
* `ResponseText(`string`)&mdash;Defines the response from the AI model.
* `Rating`(`double`)&mdash;Defines the end-user rating for this response.


The Output View is represented by the `AIPromptOutputView` class and provides the following properties:

* `OutputItems`(`IList<AIPromptOutputItem>`)&mdash;Defines a collection of the generated response items.
* `OutputItemCopyCommand`(`ICommand`)&mdash;Defines a command executed when the copy button of the generated response item is pressed.
* `OutputItemRetryCommand`(`ICommand`)&mdash;Defines a command executed when the retry button of the generated response item is pressed.
* `OutputItemRatingChangedCommand`(`ICommand`)&mdash;Defines a command executed when the rating of the generated response is changed through the UI.

Here is an example of a simple `AIPromptOutputView`:
