# Overview

**Telerik DatePicker for .NET MAUI** allows the user to select a date and visualizes its items inside a popup or a dropdown. The DatePicker control has a number of features which enable you to set a date range, date format and fully customize the dialog appearance by setting, for example, its header and footer.

## Key Features

* [Spinner format]({%slug datepicker-formatting%}#setting-the-spinner-format)&mdash;The DatePicker for .NET MAUI allows you to use a standard or custom date format string through its `SpinnerFormat` property. Depending on what format is set, the picker visualizes spinner controls with the prepopulated values ready to be picked.

* [Picker mode]({%slug datepicker-picker-mode%})&mdash;You can choose between `Popup` and `DropDown` UI for showing the spinner controls with the available date values. For Desktop the default picker mode is `DropDown` while for mobile it's `Popup`.

* [Templates]({%slug datepicker-templates%})&mdash;The DatePicker provides templates for its header and footer as well as exposes templates for its placeholder and display text.

* [DisplayString format]({%slug datepicker-formatting%}#setting-the-closed-dialog-string-format)&mdash;You can choose what text that will be displayed when a date is selected by using the `DisplayStringFormat` property of the DatePicker.

* [Date ranges]({%slug datepicker-date-range%})&mdash;You can also define date ranges by setting minimum and maximum date values, and choose a date within that range.

* [Flexible styling API]({%slug datepicker-styling%})&mdash;The DatePicker provides a number of styling capabilities, which enable you to easily style its spinners, popup and popup header and footer, the displayed text displayed after a date is selected, and more.

* [Commands support]({%slug datepicker-commands%})&mdash;The DatePicker exposes commands that allow you to clear the selected date and to open and close the popup.
