# Modal Popup

You can define whether the Popup will be modal or not through the `IsModal` Boolean property. In both cases, the UI behind the popup gets inactive and cannot be used until the popup is closed. For non-modal popups, however, you can focus the content behind by clicking outside the popup, thus hiding it.
