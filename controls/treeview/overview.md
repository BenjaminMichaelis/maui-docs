## Key features

* Hierarchical Navigation&mdash;TreeView significantly improves the navigation and performance of your application where navigation over hierarchical structure is required.
* [Expand/Collapse items]()&mdash;The control introduces methods which can be used to programmatically expand/collapse all items. 
* [Commands]() for expanding, collapsing checking and uncheking the items. 
* [CheckBox Support]()&mdash;Telerik RadTreeView provides check boxes buttons displayed next to each item. The RadTreeView allows the user to check/uncheck the nodes and to perform various tasks with the collection of checked nodes. The Tri-State CheckBox mode of RadTreeView allows for RadTreeViewItems' CheckBoxes to have an additional, third state - Indeterminate.
* [Data Binding]()&mdash;Simply setting the collection of custom business objects as an ItemsSource in combination with a "HierarchyAdapter" class is enough to visualize the hierarchically-structured source. 
* UI Virtualization&mdash;The user interface uses virtualization for displaying the required elements, meaning  that they are created only when needed and only for the currently visible cells.
* [Different selection]({% slug treeview-selection %})&mdash;The .NET MAUI TreeView supports both single and multiple selections. In addition, you can disable the selection. 
* [Vertical scrolling]()&mdash;Scroll through the items vertically and use the option to scroll to a concrete item. 
* Styling the items in the TreeView by using the style or style selector. 
* ItemTemplate for cutomizing the look of the items. 
* [Empty template]()&mdash;Set an empty template if the default one does not fit in the scenario you have.
