# Expanding and collapsing TreeView items

RadTreeView exposes useful methods which can be utilized in order to control the states of its items. You can use the following methods to chnage the state of all items:

* `ExpandAll()`&mdash;xpands all items from the source collection
* `CollapseAll()`&mdash;Collapses all items from the source collection

>important For the Treeview Expand and Collapse example refer to the [SDKBrowser Demo Application]({%slug sdkbrowser-app%}) TreeView -> Expand and Collapse category.
