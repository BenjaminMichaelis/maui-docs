# Read-Only Mode for .NET MAUI Rating

The Rating control supports a read-only mode in which the end user cannot change its `Value` (the number of the selected items). You can enable the read-only mode through `IsReadOnly` property.

Define the `RadShapeRating` in XAML:

<snippet id='rating-features-readonly' />
