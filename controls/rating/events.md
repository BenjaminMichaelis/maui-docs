# Events

The Rating provides the `ValueChanged` event, which occurs whenever the `Value` property is changed.

The `ValueChanged` event handler receives two parameters:

* The `sender` argument which is of type `object`, but can be cast to the `RadShapeRating` or `RadTemplatedRating` type.
* –ê `ValueChangedEventArgs` object, which exposes both old and new values of the `Value` property.
