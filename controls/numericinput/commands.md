# Commands

The NumericInput exposes `IncreaseCommand` and `DecreaseCommand` which could be used to define custom functionality upon the respective actions. These commands allow you to easily change and extend the control's default behavior.

In the next example, you can see how the NumericInput commands could be utilized in order to implement auto-reverse functionality â€“ start from the Minimum value when the Maximum is reached and vice versa.

1. First, create the `ViewModel` with both `IncreaseCommand` and `DecreaseCommand` implementations:

 <snippet id='numericinput-features-commands-viewmodel' />

1. Define the NumericInput with the respective bindings:

 <snippet id='numericinput-features-commands' />

 In the example:

 ```XAML
xmlns:telerik="clr-namespace:Telerik.Maui.Controls;assembly=Telerik.Maui.Controls"
 ```

>tip For a demo, refer to the **NumericInput/Features/Commands** folder of the [SDKBrowser Demo Application]({%slug maui-demo-app%}).
