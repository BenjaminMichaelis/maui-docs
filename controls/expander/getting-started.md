# .NET MAUI Expander Getting Started

This article will guide you through the steps needed to add a basic `RadExpander` control in your application.

## Adding RadExpander control

Take a look at the following topics on how to use the toolbox:

* [Telerik UI for .NET MAUI Toolbox on Mac]({%slug toolbox-support-mac%})
* [Telerik UI for .NET MAUI Toolbox on Windows]({%slug toolbox-support%})

The snippet below shows a simple `RadExpander` definition:

<snippet id='expander-getting-started-xaml' />
<snippet id='expander-gettingstarted-csharp' />

In addition to this, you need to add the following namespace:

```XAML
xmlns:telerik="http://schemas.telerik.com/2022/xaml/maui"
```
