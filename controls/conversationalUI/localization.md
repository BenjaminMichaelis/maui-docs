# .NET MAUI Conversational UI Localization

Conversational UI provides a language localization. In short, you can translate the used across the Chat control phrases to other languages, so that your app can be adapted to different regions.

>important To learn in details about the localization process of Telerik UI for .NET MAUI components, please go through the common [Localization and Globalization]({%slug globalization-localization%}) topic.

In RadChat you can localize the following string:

| Localization Key | Default Value |
| -----------------| ------------- |
| ConversationalUI_EntryWatermark | Type a message... | 

The localization key refers to the watermark message that is shown in the input field of the Chat as shown in the image below:
