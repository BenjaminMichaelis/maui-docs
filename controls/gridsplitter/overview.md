# .NET MAUI GridSplitter Overview

Telerik UI for .NET MAUI GridSplitter is a control, which allows you to redistribute the space between columns or rows of a Grid control. By dragging the splitter, the target columns or rows will be resized.

The GridSplitter control automatically detects the targeted columns/rows to resize, while dragging the control it starts to resize the columns/rows and redistributes space between columns/rows. You can control whether the GridSplitter resizes rows or columns, and which columns or rows are resized relative to the column or row for which the GridSplitter control is defined.
