# .NET MAUI DataGrid Keyboard Support on WinUI

The Telerik UI for .NET MAUI DataGrid provides keyboard navigation support on `MacCatalyst`.

While applying part of the keyboard keys, you can also change the current cell behavior of the DataGrid component. For more details, see the article on [setting the .NET MAUI DataGrid cells]({%slug datagrid-current-cell%}).

The following table lists the actions and keyboard combinations that are available in the DataGrid:
