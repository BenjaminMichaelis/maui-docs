# .NET MAUI DataGrid Keyboard Support

The Telerik UI for .NET MAUI DataGrid provides keyboard navigation support which is currently available on WinUI.

While applying part of the keyboard keys, you can also change the current cell behavior of the DataGrid component. For more details, see the article on [setting the .NET MAUI DataGrid cells]({%slug datagrid-current-cell%}).

The following table lists the actions and keyboard combinations that are available in the DataGrid:

| Hotkey Combinations  | Action 			|
|----------------------|-------------------|
| `Left Arrow`  | Focuses the next cell on the left. The selection is changed as well when in single mode. |
| `Right Arrow` | Focuses the next cell on the right. The selection is changed as well when in single mode. |
| `Up Arrow`    | Focuses the next cell above. The selection is changed as well when in single mode. |
| `Down Arrow`  | Focuses the next cell below. The selection is changed as well when in single mode. |
| `F2`          | Puts the current cell in edit mode. |
| `Enter`	      | Selects the next or previous row. When in edit mode, the changes are committed and the next row is selected. |
| `Esc`				  | Cancels the editing of the current cell. |
| `PageUp`		  | Focuses the first cell of the viewport. |
| `PageDown`	  | Focuses the last cell of the viewport. |
| `Home`	      | Focuses the first cell of the selected row. |
| `End`				  | Focuses the last cell of the selected row. |
| `Ctrl` + `Home`| Focuses the first cell of the DataGrid. |
| `Ctrl` + `End`| Focuses the last cell of the DataGrid. |
| `Tab`	        | Focuses the next cell. When in edit mode, the next cell editor is focused. |
| `Shift` + `Tab`	| Focuses the previous cell. When in edit mode, the previous editor is focused. |
