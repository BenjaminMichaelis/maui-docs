# Overview

The Telerik .NET MAUI DataForm supports different layouts which allows ou to arrange the editors. You can use the predefined layouts or create a custom one.

DataForm provides the following layouts though the `LayoutDefinition` property:

* [StackLayout]({%slug dataform-layouts-stack%})&mdash;Arranges the items of the RadDataForm in a vertical stacklayout.

* [GroupLayout]({%slug dataform-layouts-grid%})&mdash;Arranges the items of the RadDataForm in a grid layout. The grid has a pre-defined number of columns with uniform lengths.

* [FlexLayout]({%slug dataform-layouts-flex%})&mdash;Arranges the items of the RadDataForm in a flex layout.

* [CustomLayout]({%slug dataform-layouts-custom%})&mdash;Arranges the items of a Telerik.Maui.Controls.RadDataForm in a custom layout through a `LayoutTemplate`.
