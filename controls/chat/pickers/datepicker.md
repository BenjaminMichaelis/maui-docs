# .NET MAUI Chat DatePicker

The `RadChatPicker` control provides a `DatePickerContext` that can be used to display a calendar to choose a date.

`DatePickerContext` exposes the following properties you could use to provide a list of possible options to the user:

* `SelectedDate`&mdash;defines the currently selected date;
* `MinDate`&mdash;defines the min date that can be displayed and selected;
* `MaxDate`&mdash;defines the max date that can be displayed and selected;

Here is a quick example on how to user DatePicker:
