# .NET MAUI Chat Localization

The `RadChat` component provides language localization. This allows you to translate the phrases used across the Chat control to other languages so that you can adapt your app to different regions.

> To learn in details about the localization process of the Telerik UI for .NET MAUI components, see the [Localization and Globalization]({%slug globalization-localization%}) topic.

In `RadChat`, you can localize the following string:

| Localization Key | Default Value |
| -----------------| ------------- |
| `Chat_EntryPlaceholder` | `Type a message...` | 

The localization key refers to the watermark message that appears in the input field of the Chat.
