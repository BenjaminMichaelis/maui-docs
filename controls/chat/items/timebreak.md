# Chat Time Break 

The `TimeBreak` item of the `RadChat` control encapsulates a group of messages according to a certain condition, such as given time intervals or read/unread messages. It is visualized as a dividing line across the messages board with a text message attached to it. 

`TimeBreak` derives from `ChatItem` and provides an additional `Text` property which holds the string message.

### Adding a Time Break

The following example shows how to create a sample `TimeBreak` item:

<snippet id='chat-chatitems-timebreak' />
