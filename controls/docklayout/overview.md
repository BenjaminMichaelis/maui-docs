# Overview

**Telerik UI for .NET MAUI DockLayout** is a layout control that provides a mechanism for child elements to be docked to the left, right, top, or bottom edge, or to occupy the central area of the layout.

## Key Features

* [Docking functionality]({% slug docklayout-docking %})&mdash;You can set the position of each child element inside the layout as well as render multiple child elements to one side.
* [Adaptable docking]({% slug docklayout-docking %}#setting-the-position-of-the-last-child-element)&mdash;The DockLayout enables you to overwrite the default behavior of the last docked element, which stretches over the remaining space that is unoccupied by the other child elements.
