# Overview #

**Telerik RadDockLayout for .NET MAUI** is a layout that provides a mechanism for child elements to be docked to the left, right, top or bottom edge or to occupy the center area of the layout.

## Key features

* **Docking functionality**: You can easily set the position of each child element inside the layout through *RadDockLayout.Dock* attached property. For more details on this check [Docking feature]({% slug docklayout-docking%}#docking-functionality) topic.
* **Adaptable docking**: By default, the last docked element will stretch along the remaining space not occupied by the other child elements. You can prevent this behavior through `StretchLastChild` property of the DockLayout control. Go to [Configure last child element position]({% slug docklayout-docking%}#configure-last-child-element-position) for more information regarding this.
