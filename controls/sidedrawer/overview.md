# Overview

**Telerik UI for .NET MAUI SideDrawer** is designed to enable users to visualize a hidden view in their applications. That view can host navigation UI, common settings or any other UI of your choice. It can be visualized using a flick gesture on mobile or custom UI which has to manipulate the `IsOpen` property on Desktop. In addition Telerik SideDrawer for .NET MAUI can be shown from all four sides of the screen.
