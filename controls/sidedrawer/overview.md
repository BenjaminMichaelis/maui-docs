# Overview

`Telerik UI for .NET MAUI SideDrawer Control` is designed to enable users to visualize a hidden view in their applications. That view can host navigation UI, common settings or any other UI of your choice. It can be visualized using a flick gesture and can be shown from all four sides of the screen.
