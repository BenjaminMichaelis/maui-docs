# .NET MAUI CollectionView Localization

The Telerik .NET MAUI `RadCollectionView` component provides language localization. This allows you to translate the phrases used across the CollectionView control to other languages so that you can adapt your app to different regions.

> To learn in details about the localization process of the Telerik UI for .NET MAUI components, see the [Localization and Globalization]({%slug globalization-localization%}) topic.

In `RadCollectionView`, you can localize the following string:

| Localization Key | Default Value |
| -----------------| ------------- |
| `CollectionView_ManualLoadOnDemandText` | `Load More` |
