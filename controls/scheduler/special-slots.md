# Special Slots

The Telerik UI for .NET MAUI Scheduler control exposes an option to define the special and read-only slots and apply different styles to them. You need to prepare a collection of Slot objects and assign it to `SpecialSlotsSource` property of the `RadScheduler`.

Every Slot has the following properties:

* `Start (type DateTime)`&mdash;Defines the start date of the slot.
* `End (type DateTime)`&mdash;Defines the end date of the slot.
* `ReccurencePattern`&mdash;Defines whether the slot will be displayed for repeating days.
* `IsReadOnly`&mdash;When set to `True` the slot is disabled.

The example below shows how to set the special slots:
