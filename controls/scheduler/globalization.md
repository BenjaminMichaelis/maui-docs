# .NET MAUI Scheduler Globalization

Globalization refers to developing an application in such a way that it works on the target device culture. This includes changes in the Calendar day names and first day of week.

The Telerik UI for .NET MAUI Scheduler control supports globalization through the `Culture` property (of type `System.Globalization.CultureInfo`).

`RadScheduler` supports the following .NET Framework calendar implementations:

* `HijriCalendar`, which represents the `Hijri` calendar.
* `UmAlQuraCalendar`, which represents the `Um Al Qura` calendar.
* `HebrewCalendar`, which represents the `Hebrew` calendar.
* `PersianCalendar`, the Persian calendar.
* `GregorianCalendar`, which represents the `Gregorian` calendar.
* `ThaiBuddhistCalendar`, which represents the `Thai Buddhist` calendar.
* `TaiwanCalendar`, which represents the `Taiwan` calendar.

The following example demonstrates how to set the desired culture in the `RadScheduler`:
