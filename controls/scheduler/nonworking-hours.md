# Nonworking Hours

The Telerik UI for .NET MAUI Scheduler control lets you define the daily business hours during the working week in the different views. This allows you to adjust the work start and end times and the remaining hours of the day will be styled differently, so users can recognize them as non-working time.

The control exposes a `IsWeekendVisible` property which defines a value that indicates whether the weekend days are visible, so that only the work week is displayed.

The example below shows how to set the non-working hours in the `RadScheduler`:
