# .NET MAUI Scheduler Header Visual Structure

 Scheduler for .NET MAUI provides a header which can be used to quickly switch between the available views as well as navigate to a different date. In additon, the header includes an optional Today button for navigating directly to Today date.

The following image shows the anatomy of the Scheduler Header on desktop and mobile.

* **Available Views**&mdash;List of the views the user can choose from. On desktop the list is always visible in the header, while on mobile users would need to tap on the options button to see it.
