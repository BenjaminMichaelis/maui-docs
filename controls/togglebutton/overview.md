# .NET MAUI ToggleButton Overview

The Telerik UI for .NET MAUI ToggleButton component represents a button that can be toggled between two states: toggled and untoggled. It allows end users to select or toggle an option or a state in an application's user interface.

The ToggleButton is commonly used in scenarios to capture and represent a binary choice, such as enabling or disabling a feature, activating or deactivating a setting, or toggling between two different modes or views.
