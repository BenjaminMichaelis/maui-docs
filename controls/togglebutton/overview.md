# .NET MAUI ToggleButton Overview

The Telerik UI for .NET MAUI ToggleButton control represents a button that can be toggled between two states - toggled and untoggled. The main purpose of the control is to allow users to select or toggle an option or a state in an application's user interface.

It is commonly used in scenarios where there is a need to capture and represent a binary choice, such as enabling or disabling a feature, activating, or deactivating a setting, or toggling between two different modes or views.
