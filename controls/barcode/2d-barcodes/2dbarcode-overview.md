# Two-Dimensional Barcodes Overview

The matrix barcode is a two-dimensional (2D) way for representing information.

It can also be referred to as a 2D barcode or simply a 2D code. 2D barcodes are similar to the linear (1D) barcodes, but can represent more data per unit area.

Currently, the RadBarcode supports the following matrix barcode types:

* [QR Code]({% slug barcode-qrcode-overview%})
* [PDF417]({% slug barcode-pdf417-overview%})
* [SwissQR Code]({% slug barcode-swissqrcode-overview%})
