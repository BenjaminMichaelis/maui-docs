# .NET MAUI SlideView Events 

When the current item or its index changes, the SlideView control emits the `CurrentItemChanged` event. You can handle the event and customize the behavior of the component.

## Example

To handle the `CurrentItemChanged` event of RadSlideView:

**1.** Add the SlideView definition.

<snippet id='slideview-events' />

**2.** Add the event handler.

<snippet id='slideview-events-current-item-changed-event' />
