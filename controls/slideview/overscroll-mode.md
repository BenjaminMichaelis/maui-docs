# .NET MAUI SlideView OverScroll Mode

The `OverScrollMode` property defines the possible behavior of the SlideView control in cases where the items cannot move in the direction selected by the user.

The `OverScrollMode` property has two modes:

* `None`&mdash;No overscroll will happen.
* `Spring`(Default)&mdash;The end-user will be able to move an item in a direction that is otherwise not allowed, but the offset will be smaller than the pointer movement, thus creating a spring effect.
