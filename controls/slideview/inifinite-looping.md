# .NET MAUI SlideView Infinite Looping

By default, when you reach the last view, the **Next** button won't do anything. You can change this behavior through the `Has Looping` property and allow the repeating of the views when the user reaches the last view.

`HasLooping`(Default value`False`)&mdash;This property allows to achieve infinite looping.
